				<p class="warning">It is very important to go through below given instructions before taking the survey. Kindly read each and every instruction carefully before starting.</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="text">The survey will be done for 300 images (150 males and 150 females). It will take around 1-1.25 hours to complete the survey.</li>
					<li class="text">It is recommended to complete the whole survey in 4 sittings, with each sitting of about 15-20 minutes long. The survey is distributed into 4 parts as explained below.</li>
					<li class="text">As expailned on the index page, the images are taken from 4 different databases. Images of database 1 are similar to database 2 and images of database 3 are similar to database 4. Clubbing these sets together gives us 2 datasets which will further be divided into males and females, leaving us with 4 different datasets. So suppose your gender is male, your 4 sitting will be like-
					<ul>
						<li>Sitting 1: female dataset 1 (75 images)</li>
						<li>Sitting 2: female dataset 2 (75 images)</li>
						<li>Sitting 3: male dataset 1 (75 images)</li>
						<li>Sitting 4: male dataset 2 (75 images)</li>	
					</ul></li>
					<li class="text">You should maintain a time difference of minimum 4 hours between each sitting and should complete the task of a single sitting in one go i.e. without taking a break.</li>
					<li class="text">You have to score the facial attractiveness of the images on a scale of 1 to 10. You can move between images of a set as many times as you want.</li>
					<li class="text">A score of each image will be captured on clicking submit button attached with each image and the final submission will not be accepted unless all the images have been scored.</li>
					<li class="text">It is recommended to go through all the images quickly before you start to score in each sitting. This will give you an idea of the type of faces dataset have.</li>
					<li class="text">Your score should not be based on the race or the skin color of the person. Your score should only be based on the attractiveness of facial features.</li>
					<li class="text">It is recommended to take the survey alone so that your score don't get influenced by others.</li>
					<li class="text">Take time to complete the survey and do not finish it in hassle.</li>
